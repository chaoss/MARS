\section{Release History}\label{release-history}}

CHAOSS metrics are released continuously. The regular release is when we
update the version number, update the full release notes, and make a big
announcement. These releases occur one to two times a year and may
correspond with the dates of a CHAOSScon event. Prior to regular
release, continuous released metrics go through a comment period of at
least 30 days.

    Updated focus areas. Refactored the "Code Development" focus area
    into 3 separate focus areas to more closely align with other working
    groups. Rather than having one broad focus area with multiple
    subsections, we decided our intent would be better communicated by
    making each of these subsections into their own focus areas. The 3
    separate focus areas include:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Code Development Activity
    \item
      Code Development Efficiency
    \item
      Code Development Process Quality
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Kept the other 2 focus areas (Issue Resolution and Community Growth)
    the same.
  \item
    No major changes were made to already existing metrics.
  \end{itemize}
\item
