Demand}\label{organizational-project-skill-demand}}

Question: How many organizations are using this project and could hire
me if I become proficient?

\hypertarget{description}{%
\paragraph{Description}\label{description}}

Organizations engage with open source projects through use and
dependencies. This metric is aimed at determining downstream demand of
skills related to an open source project. This metric looks at
organizations that deploy a project as part of an IT infrastructure,
other open source projects with declared dependencies, and references to
the project through social media, conference mentions, blog posts, and
similar activities.

As a developer, I'd like to invest my skills and time in a project that
has a likelihood of getting me a decent paying job in the future. People
can use the Downstream Organizational Impact of a Project Software
metric to discover which projects are used by organizations, and they
may, therefore, be able to pursue job opportunities with, possibly
requiring IT support services.

\paragraph{Implementation}\label{implementation}}

Base metrics include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Number of organizations that created issues for a project
\item
  Number of organizations that created pull requests for a project
\item
  Number of organizations that blog or tweet about a project
\item
  Number of organizations that mention a project in open hiring requests
\item
  Number of organizations that are represented at meetups about this
  project
\item
  Number of other projects that are dependent on a project
\item
  Number of books about a project
\item
  Google search trends for a project
\end{itemize}

The following visualization demonstrates the number of downstream
projects dependendent on the project in question. While this
visualization does not capture the entirety of the Downstream
Organizational Impact of a Project Software metric, it provides a visual
for a portion.

Other visualizations could include Google search trends (React vs.
Angular vs. Vue.js)
