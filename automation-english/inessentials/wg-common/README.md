## Background

The Common Metrics Working Group focuses on defining the metrics that are used by both 
working groups or are important for community health, but that do not cleanly fit into 
one of the other existing working groups. Areas of interest include organizational affiliation, 
responsiveness, geographic coverage, and more.

### Work To Date

We are involved in the release of CHAOSS metrics. Check out our published work at [https://chaoss.community/metrics/](https://chaoss.community/metrics/)
