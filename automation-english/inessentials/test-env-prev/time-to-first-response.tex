\section{Time to First Response}\label{time-to-first-response}}

Question: How much time passes between when an activity requiring
attention is created and the first response?

\hypertarget{description}{%
\subsection{Description}\label{description}}

The first response to an activity can sometimes be the most important
response. The first response shows that a community is active and
engages in conversations. A long time to respond to an activity can be a
sign that a community is not responsive. A short time to respond to an
activity can help to engage more members into further discussions and
within the community.

\hypertarget{objectives}{%
\subsection{Objectives}\label{objectives}}

Identify cadence of first response across a variety of activities,
including PRs, Issues, emails, IRC posts, etc. Time to first response is
an important consideration for new and long-time contributors to a
project along with overall project health.

\hypertarget{implementation}{%
\subsection{Implementation}\label{implementation}}

Time to first response of an activity = time first response was posted
to the activity - time the activity was created.
